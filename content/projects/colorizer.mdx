Created an AI tool for automatic image colorization, leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, CNN model near to industry standard with PyTorch and ResNet trained on 100k images.

Architected a scalable and fault-tolerant system using containerized microservices and Kubernetes for
deploying model.
